#Forum Notifier

Keep tabs on all those forum sites / accounts. Sends you desktop notifications for new alerts, messages and \<whatever else\>, allows you to change the signature, profile image and more for all (or specific) accounts, displays (and tracks) account stats and more, all in one easy-to-use, clean interface. In addition, a mobile version (for Android and possibly iOS) is a future possibility. If you have any other ideas or suggestions, please share them [here](https://github.com/Cldfire/Forum-Notifier/issues/26).

Please note that this project is currrently in the early stages of development.
